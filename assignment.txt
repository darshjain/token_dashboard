Hi Darsh,
It was great speaking with you in your virtual interview for the Crypto Full‑Stack Developer Intern role. Congrats on advancing. We’d like to invite you to the next stage: a short take‑home that reflects day‑to‑day work on our team.

What’s next
A focused build that typically takes 6–8 hours. Please submit within 5 calendar days. If you need a different timeline, reply to this email and we’ll coordinate.

Your exercise (summary)
Create a small web app that lists key items from Indices/Indicators with a 30‑day detail view. Use a server‑side route to call the API (keys in env), cache responses, refresh no faster than every 60–120 seconds, and respect plan limits (20 req/min, 500 calls/month). Optional: one WebSocket stream.

Submission checklist

Deployed app link + GitHub repo


README with environment setup and caching strategy


Loom video ≤10 minutes


One folder link containing everything


We’re excited to see what you build.
